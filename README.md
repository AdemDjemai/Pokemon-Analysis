## 📍 Overview

Expliquer le projet ici avec quelques mots

---

## 💫 Features

Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **🏗 Structure and Organization** | The codebase is organized into directories based on the type of analysis being performed, and each directory contains a Jupyter notebook with a specific focus on analyzing Pokemon data. |
| **📝 Code Documentation** | The code is well-documented with detailed explanations of each step taken in the analysis process. |
| **🧩 Dependency Management** | Dependencies are managed using a requirements.txt file, which lists all external Python packages needed to run the analyses. |
| **♻️ Modularity and Reusability** | The code is modular and reusable, with functions defined in separate code cells and imported as needed throughout the notebook. |
| **✔️ Testing and Quality Assurance** | There are no explicit tests in the codebase and there is no indication of testing and quality assurance methods being used. |
| **⚡️ Performance and Optimization** | The code does not appear to be optimized for performance, though the nature of the analysis being performed may not require heavy optimization. |
| **🔒 Security Measures** | There is no indication of security measures being implemented in the codebase. |
| **🔄 Version Control and Collaboration** | The codebase is version-controlled using Git, with each analysis being committed as a separate branch. Collaboration does not appear to be a primary focus of the project. |
| **🔌 External Integrations** | There are no external integrations utilized in the codebase. |
| **📈 Scalability and Extensibility** | The codebase could potentially scale and be extended by adding additional analyses or expanding the scope of current analyses. However, the absence of explicit modularity or testing may limit the project's scalability. |

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project on your account that you can modify without affecting the original project.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client like Git or GitHub Desktop.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-feature-branch` or `bugfix-issue-123`).
```sh
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```
4. Make changes to the project's codebase.
5. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made.
```sh
git commit -m 'Implemented new feature.'
```
6. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command
```sh
git push origin new-feature-branch
```
7. Create a pull request to the original repository.
Open a new pull request to the original project repository. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made and why they're necessary.
The project maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback or merge them into the main branch.
